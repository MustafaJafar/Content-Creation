"""
"abstraction" meaning depends on the context of the conversation. 

In general, it means writing empty functions to redefine them later

So, you might visualize your code from the outside in.
Like if you have an overall view of your code, that's when you start filling in the details

Like starting your sketch by drawing primitive shapes. 

You can choose this method when you have a solid idea of what you are going to do
And you sure how to do it!
