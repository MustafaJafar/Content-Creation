    Later on this presentaion, we should point out to: 
    - Why python is favored for beginners 
    - What are types of Instructions for a programming language 
    - What we can create with python 

- Python installation 
  - Download & Install 
  - Try Python Interpreter in CMD
  - Install packages 

- Some fun with jupyter, [*check code*](resources/01-python-intro)
  - Arithmetic Expressions
  - Input / Output
  - Variables I 
    - Numbers and Characters
  - Comparisons and Logic Operations
  - Variables II (Sequences of data) 
    - String, List, Tuple, Dictionary
    > They can be considered as smart variables <br>
    > which contains data placeholders with built-in processes <br>
    > e.g. list: data sequence placholder  , process: list.sort() <br>
    > e.g. String: characters sequence placeholder , process: str.lower() , str.title() , str.capitalize()  <br>
  - Functions
  - Classes 
    > How to cerate your own smart variable, However classes are more than that! 
  - Modules 
  - Packages
