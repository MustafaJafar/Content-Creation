# Programming Introduction
It's more about making a good plan than being clever, [read more](https://microcredentials.digitalpromise.org/explore/planning-before-programming).

## Preparation 

- Install VS Code
- My daily workflow using python  
  - Python files
  - Run in CMD
  - Markdown documentations


## Programming Process 

1) Identidy problem you want to solve in code
2) Answer the **What, Why and How** questions 
     - what is the problem you are trying to solve ? (*answer in 1 sentence*)
     - Why you want to solve this problem ? 
     - How will you solve it ?

3) Solution planning

   - Take a moment and think about the problem you are solving, recognize its inputs and the desired outputs, and then think about the process/solution that will transform the inputs to outputs.

   - Then do some pre-coding activities which include writing problem statements and mapping out solutions using storyboards, pseudocode, or flowcharts.

   - You can Google "storyboards", "pseudocode", or "flowcharts" to learn more about them.

4) Code Planning
 
    Where you start to break into writing code
    There are two possible ways
      1) Abstraction (Imagine as a whole), [*check code*](resources/02-programming-intro/abstraction.py)

      2) Continuous development (piece-by-piece), [*check code*](resources/02-programming-intro/continuous-development.ipynb)
