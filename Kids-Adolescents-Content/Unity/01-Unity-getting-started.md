## Asset Store Vs. Package Manager 

Asset Store: **Window** > **Asset Store**  which forwards you to the [online Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/)


    Asset Store is an online library for unity assets that were premade and ready to use in your project whether free assets or paid assets



Getting your first asset. 

- [Starter Assets - Third Person Character Controller](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526)

    [![Starter Assets overview | Unity](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4QuPlKzdq14/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QuPlKzdq14)



Package Manager: **Window** > **Package Manager**  

    Package Manager is used to manage 
        Unity packages (e.g. WebGL Publisher)
        Assets (e.g. to import the asset we previously got from store) 


Packages are filtered based on the package scope drop-down menu  
- Package scope drop-down **Packages: In Project**

## Challenge 

Build a whitbox scene from your imagination, add `Third Person Character` asset to your project, and then play your scene. 

you may want to check [types of light](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Lighting.html). 

### Why whitebox scenes are usefull? 
To speed up game production cycle. 
In a prototype of a game, a colleague is modeling the enemy character while you work on gameplay. Your placeholder for the enemy is a capsule primitive. When the enemy is ready to import, you then simply replace the capsule object with the new model.
