# Learn Unity

Advices and Inspirations

## Advices : 

1) **Be realistic**: 
    Most beginners decide to create a project that’s both too big and too hard to make, and then he/she get frustrated and quit. 
    So, you may take your game idea and cut it in half many times till you have a possible game

2) **Scope** : 
    Take a simple game and break it down into very tiny specific mechanics, that you would then work on to combine into a final project.

3) Identify the problem you are tyring to solve 
4) **Be patient**: Achieving your goals won’t happen overnight. 
5) **Stick with it**: Life is full of ups and downs, Be persistent and positive.
6) **Communication**: The best way to succeed is to find other people, and work with them. 
7) **Complete your plan**: The best advice is to finish your project. 
    Choose an idea that you can finish.
    
    Employers want to know that you can see a project from start to end.
    
    - Is my goal achievable in the next 30, 60, or 90 days? 
    - Is my goal specific and measurable?
    If I were to scope my goal, could I realistically build it in a reasonable timeframe? 
    - What assets do I need to create for my project, such as audio, characters, backgrounds, and user interfaces? 
    - What skills would I need to create and assemble those assets? (It’s okay if you don’t know all of the skills — identify what you can.) 
    - What mindsets and traits do I want to work on? 
     
8) **Share your Plan** — either as a one- to three-minute video, or as a screenshot of your document.
