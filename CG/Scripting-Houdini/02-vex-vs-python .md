# VEX vs Python 

This tutorial is divided into 4 examples.<br>
Most of the time, These examples are based on comparison where you learn by achieving the same results in both vex and python and then deducing the difference.

### VEX Note: 
As mentioned in [houdini docs](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/vex/index.html), VEX is not an alternative to python scripting, but rather a smaller, more efficient general purpose language for manipulating attributes, editing parameters and writing shaders.



## Example 1 Foundations

A walkthrough to learn about `python` and `vex` syntax. <br>
Some commands in `python` and its `vex` equivalent

## Example 2 Python main usage

In my opinion, python in houdini has two main uses 
1) To create and connect nodes 
2) To modify parameters of nodes

## Example 3 Attributes & Channels

In this example, I'm exploring how python and vex deal with attributes and parameters.

## Example 4 Python in action

In this example, I'm exploring 3 exercises that summarize some of my day-to-day Python scripting for houdini
