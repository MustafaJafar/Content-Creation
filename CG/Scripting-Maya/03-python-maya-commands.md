# Python Scripting for Maya

If you don't already know Python, consider starting with a crash course in Python like [this one](https://github.com/mustafa-zarkash/Content-Creation/tree/main/Kids-Adolescents-Content/python-crash-course), or a full introductory course about python like [this one](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python).

<br>

Python scripting for maya is made possible by the `maya` python module which extends the functionality of python and which enables Maya users to do things in Maya using python commands.

```
from maya import cmds , mel 

cmds.polySphere()
mel.eval("polySphere;")
```

> Disclaimer: This guide is a fraction of the whole `maya` python module.<br>
